Campuses of colleges and universities are meant to be vibrant, free-flowing, and dynamic in nature.
An accommodating campus supports idea exchange, personal growth, and soft skill development. 
The safety of students, especially women's students, is a pillar of an accommodating campus. 
In the present scenario, the measures available to college administrators and students, such as the installation of CCTV cameras, increased security on campuses, and the establishment of police outposts, are reactive in nature, i.e., they are pressed into action only after the occurrence of a mishap. 
The objective of the problem statement is to develop predictive analytic models to prevent mishaps even before they occur. 
The second issue pertaining to women's safety is the lack of manpower for proactive interventions to prevent mishaps. 
Another objective is to develop, monitor, predict, and provide actionable intelligence for the prevention of mishaps.
The solution can explore the contours of anonymous and non-anonymous data collection mechanisms, point-to-point reporting systems, and predictive data analytics for providing actionable intelligence.
Further, the collected data can be leveraged to develop and mark probable black spots and red time zones for pin-pointed actions to be taken by administrators. 
To promote a community-based system, the system may be designed in such a way that it not only gathers information from students but also involves the entire student community in the prevention of mishaps. 
The data collected from the participants can be populated into the system, and real-time monitoring can be done with an interactive dashboard and charts. 
It can also be used to develop real-time rapid intervention by the student community, college administration, and local authorities.
Further to this, a companion model can also be developed for students that helps them travel through black spots and during red time zones.
This will not only ensure the community participation of students but also develop a responsibility-sharing framework for campus safety.
